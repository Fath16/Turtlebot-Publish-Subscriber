         rospy.init_node('turtlemove', anonymous=True)
         pub  = rospy.Publisher('/turtle1/cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=10)
         rate = rospy.Rate(10)
      
      
         vel = Twist()
      
      
         while True:
             vel.linear.x= line_vel
             vel.linear.y= 0
             vel.linear.z= 0
      
      
             vel.angular.x= 0
             vel.angular.y= 0
             vel.angular.z= ang_vel
      
      
             pub.publish(vel)
             rate.sleep()
